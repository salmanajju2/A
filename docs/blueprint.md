## Core Features:

- Transaction Recording: Record cash and UPI transactions with detailed denomination breakdown and categorization, persisting data locally.
- Denomination Vault Adjustment: Manually adjust denomination counts to account for discrepancies or non-transactional changes.
- Data Import/Export Tool: Export existing transaction data in various formats (like CSV or JSON) and use an AI tool to intelligently import similar information for future sessions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#778DA9) to invoke a sense of professionalism and trust, reflecting financial responsibility.
- Background color: Very light gray (#EEEEEE) provides a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted red (#E29578) will provide contrast without being alarming or distracting. Used to highlight specific information and important interactions.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, providing readability, and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, lending a slightly modern touch.
- Use a set of minimalist line icons from 'lucide-react' to represent transaction types, account actions, and navigation elements.
- A clean, card-based layout provides well-defined blocks of content. Employ responsive design principles to optimize the layout for both desktop and mobile screens.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations, such as fade-in effects or button hover states, to enhance the user experience.
